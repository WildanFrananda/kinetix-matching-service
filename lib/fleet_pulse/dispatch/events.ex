defmodule FleetPulse.Dispatch.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  Topic names and typed events for dispatch broadcasts.

  A driver's channel subscribes to `dispatch:driver:<id>` on join, so an
  assignment can be pushed to the device the instant it is made (PRD 5.5).

  The `dispatch:` prefix keeps these topics disjoint from the channel's own
  `driver:<id>` topic AND from the tracking context's `tracking:driver:<id>`.
  Three namespaces share one PubSub server; an unprefixed name would collide.
